### Data 
* Files \[ Time; Values \]
  *  Bid Price
  *  Bid Volume
  *  Ask Price
  *  Ask Volum
  *  MO 

### 1 step

Build a file with all the LO : Time, Ask Price, Bid Price, Ask Volum and Bid Volum

* **Merging.py
 * MergedTimebis.csv: \['Time','Offer_Bid','Row' \]
   * 'Time' 
   * 'Offer' = o, 'Bid' = b or 'Bid and Offer' = ob, 

   * 'Row' of the bid in the file , 'Offer_Row' = row of the offer in the file 
   OR
   * 'Row' of the offer in its file, 'Offer_Row' = empty

### 2 step

Buil a same file but only with spread = Bid - Ask = 1

### 3 step

Compute Imbalance and True price

Plot the 'Distribution of traded volume across imbalance levels, for spread = 1â€™
